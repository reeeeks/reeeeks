- 👋 Hi, I’m @reeeeks (that's not my real name, though).
- 👀 I have a keen interest in the world of games, music, and crafting software that weaves them together
- 🕹️ Choosing just three of my favorite games is a challenging task, but some that hold a special place in my heart include `Tunic`, `Return of the Obra Dinn` and `A Monster's Expedition Through Puzzling Exhibitions` among many others.
- 🎵 My musical tastes primarily gravitate towards Italian songwriters, while I also find joy in the realms of funk, electronic, as well as blues and folk music.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything I can about full-stack development and devops, building on my foundation in web development. I'm passionate about creating interactive web applications and deploying them flawlessly.
- 🚀 I'm excited to keep growing and applying my skills to build innovative projects that bridge my passions. If you share my interests or want to discuss collaborations, feel free to get in touch at rumiriccardo@gmail.com.
